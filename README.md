The images for hemispheres are not available due to the website being down

passing image urls inside the list of dictionarys and rendering the html with an image box and src  - the framework is there but I cant get the image to render.  Ill keep working on it. 

the table files...  in the example there was a saple of pulling in the html for the table..  

the get_text() isnt working with the other sites. but I think its addressing the element inside the file sctructure. 

I will meet with the TA and see if we cant figure.
